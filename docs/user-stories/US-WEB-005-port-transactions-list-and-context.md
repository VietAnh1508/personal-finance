# US-WEB-005: Port Transactions List and Wallet Context Behavior

## User Story
As a user,
I want to view transactions with wallet context and calculated totals,
so that I can understand my current financial position.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Transactions list renders from local data and groups by date.
2. Wallet context supports "All Wallets" and specific wallet selection.
3. Header total reflects selected context using existing domain rules.
4. Last selected wallet context is persisted and restored.
5. Archived wallets follow existing visibility and selection rules.
