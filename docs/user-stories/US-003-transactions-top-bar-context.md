# US-003: Transactions Top Bar Context

## User Story
As a user,
I want quick context controls in the Transactions top bar,
so that I can switch wallet scope and view the current total quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Top-left shows wallet selector trigger as icon-only control.
2. Top-center shows total amount for current wallet context.
3. If context is `All Wallets`, center total equals combined total of all active wallets.
4. Top-right shows actions menu icon with actions: `Transfer` and `Adjust balance`.
