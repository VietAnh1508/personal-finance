# US-WEB-000: Set Up React SPA Baseline (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind)

## User Story
As a developer,
I want to initialize a React SPA baseline for web migration,
so that feature development can proceed on a stable and fast web foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new web app scaffold exists using React + TypeScript + Vite.
2. Tailwind CSS is installed and configured.
3. Standard scripts are available for dev, build, lint, typecheck, and test.
4. The app runs locally and a production build succeeds.
5. A short setup guide is documented for local development.
