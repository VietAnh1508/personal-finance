# US-011: Manage Wallets With Archiving

## User Story
As a user,
I want to manage wallets safely,
so that historical data stays consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can create, edit, and archive wallets in Settings.
2. Archiving a wallet excludes it from `All Wallets` unified list and combined balance.
3. Archived wallets cannot be selected for new transfers.
4. If last used wallet becomes archived, app defaults to `All Wallets` on launch.
