# US-017: Set Up Automated Test Infrastructure

## User Story
As a developer,
I want a reliable test setup for unit and integration tests,
so that feature acceptance criteria can be verified automatically before release.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Project includes a working test runner configuration suitable for Expo + TypeScript.
2. A standard command is available to run tests locally (for example, `pnpm test`).
3. Base test utilities are configured for React Native component/integration testing.
4. At least one sample unit test and one sample component/integration test run successfully in CI/local.
5. Test setup documentation is added with clear instructions for writing and running tests.
