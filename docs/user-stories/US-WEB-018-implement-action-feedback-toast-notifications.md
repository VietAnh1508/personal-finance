# US-WEB-018: Implement Action Feedback Toast Notifications

## User Story
As a user,
I want immediate feedback after actions complete,
so that I know whether the operation succeeded or failed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Web app provides a reusable toast feedback mechanism that can be triggered from any feature screen.
2. Wallet creation shows a success toast on completion and an error toast on failure.
3. Wallet update shows a success toast on completion and an error toast on failure.
4. Toast auto-dismisses after a short duration and does not block normal navigation or interaction.
