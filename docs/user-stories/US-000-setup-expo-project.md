# US-000: Set Up Expo Project

## User Story
As a developer,
I want to initialize and configure the Expo project baseline,
so that the team can start implementing MVP features on a stable foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A React Native Expo project is initialized with TypeScript enabled.
2. Project can run locally on iOS simulator/device via Expo Dev Client workflow.
3. Core dependencies are installed and configured:
   - `@react-navigation/native`
   - `zustand`
   - `react-hook-form`
   - `zod`
   - `dayjs`
   - `expo-sqlite`
4. Base app structure exists for screens, domain/services, and data access layers.
5. Lint/typecheck scripts are available and pass on a clean checkout.
6. A short setup guide is documented for running the project locally.
