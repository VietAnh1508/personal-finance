# US-WEB-004: Port Wallet Setup and Currency Onboarding Flows

## User Story
As a first-time user,
I want to set my currency and create my first wallet,
so that I can start tracking transactions with correct display settings.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. First launch flow prompts for currency selection before wallet creation.
2. Currency options and metadata are sourced from shared domain model.
3. First wallet creation captures wallet name, icon, and initial balance.
4. On completion, app navigates to transactions area.
5. Flow state is persisted locally and restored after refresh.
