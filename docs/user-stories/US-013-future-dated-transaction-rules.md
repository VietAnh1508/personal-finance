# US-013: Future-Dated Transaction Rules

## User Story
As a user,
I want consistent handling of future-dated transactions,
so that current balances and reports are predictable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Future-dated transactions are allowed.
2. Transactions-tab balance excludes transactions with date after today.
3. Reports include future-dated transactions when selected range includes them.
