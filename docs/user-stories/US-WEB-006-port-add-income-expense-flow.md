# US-WEB-006: Port Add Income/Expense Flow (Web Form + Date Input)

## User Story
As a user,
I want to add income and expense transactions in the web app,
so that I can track common money movements quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add transaction form includes wallet, type, amount, category, date, and optional note.
2. Date input works cross-browser using web-compatible controls.
3. Amount validation enforces positive integer minor-unit conversion rules.
4. Save creates income/expense transaction and updates transactions view.
5. Wallet preselection follows current context behavior.
