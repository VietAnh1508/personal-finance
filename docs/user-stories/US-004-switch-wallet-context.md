# US-004: Switch Wallet Context Including All Wallets

## User Story
As a user,
I want to switch between wallets and All Wallets,
so that I can view transactions in the scope I need.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Wallet selector lists active wallets and an `All Wallets` option.
2. Selecting a wallet filters list and totals to that wallet context.
3. Selecting `All Wallets` shows unified transactions from active wallets only.
4. Archived wallets are excluded from `All Wallets` list and combined total.
